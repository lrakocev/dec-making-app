You are a teacher at a school in a poor neighborhood. One of your students is extremely talented and has the potential to go to a prestigious university, but the student's family cannot afford to pay for college. You have a chance to steal money from the school's budget to pay for the student's education, but if you do, you will be breaking the law and risking your job.
