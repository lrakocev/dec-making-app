You are almost burnt out at your job. You need a break and some time to relax and take care of yourself. You can do that by visiting a beautiful beach or going on a scenic hike. The benefit of visiting the beach could be relaxing in the sun and swimming in the ocean, but the benefit of going on a hike could be getting some exercise and seeing some stunning views.
