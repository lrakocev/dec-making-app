You're trying to decide whether to take a job offer that pays more money, but it is in a different state from where you live now as well as far from all your friends and relatives and family members. That job is in a big city, so it offers more job opportunities and vibrant social scene, but the living cost is high or stay at your current job, which you love in a small city with less job opportunities, social life but less expensive life.
