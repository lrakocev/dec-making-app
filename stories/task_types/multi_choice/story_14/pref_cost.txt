51) Let's say you're a movie production house owner who is trying to decide whether to expand your operations into a new market. You're faced with a multi-choice conflict situation. You can either invest heavily in marketing and advertising to build brand awareness, or you can focus on building strategic partnerships with other businesses in the new market.

Ultimately, you have to decide which choice is more important to you.
