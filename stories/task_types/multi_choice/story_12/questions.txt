Would you like to launch a well-coordinated frontal assault to swiftly overcome the enemy's defenses, potentially achieving a quick victory, or execute a precise flanking maneuver to surprise the enemy and gain a strategic advantage, potentially ensuring minimal casualties? (R1C1, R2C2)
Will you choose a frontal assault with strategic support to minimize casualties and maximize progress, potentially ensuring effective backup, or opt for a well-communicated flanking maneuver to cut off the enemy's supply lines effectively, potentially disrupting their operations? (R1C3, R2C4)
Is it preferable to launch a frontal assault after thorough reconnaissance to exploit weak points in the enemy's defenses, potentially capitalizing on their vulnerabilities, or execute a carefully planned flanking maneuver, utilizing the terrain to outmaneuver and surprise the enemy, potentially ensuring strategic success? (R1C5, R2C6)
Do you intend to employ diversionary tactics to draw the enemy's attention away from the main attack, potentially creating confusion and opportunities, or utilize specialized units to neutralize the enemy's strongest defenses before launching the assault, potentially ensuring a smoother advance? (R1C7, R2C8)
Will you implement a combined arms approach, utilizing infantry, armor, and air support for a successful attack, potentially ensuring superior firepower, or conduct a night-time assault to take advantage of reduced visibility and disorient the enemy, potentially catching them off guard? (R1C9, R2C10)
Do you plan to utilize electronic warfare capabilities to disrupt the enemy's communication and coordination, potentially causing confusion and disarray among their ranks, or employ psychological warfare tactics to undermine the enemy's morale and cohesion, potentially weakening their resolve? (R1C11, R2C12)
Would you be willing to launch a frontal assault without proper reconnaissance, risking heavy casualties and limited progress, or execute a poorly coordinated flanking maneuver, potentially leading to confusion and disarray among your troops? (R3C1, R4C2)
Will you choose to attack head-on without adequate backup, potentially leaving your forces vulnerable to enemy counterattacks, or opt for a flanking maneuver without proper communication, risking isolation and loss of contact with your main force? (R3C3, R4C4)
Is it acceptable to launch a frontal assault without considering the enemy's defensive capabilities, risking a futile and costly attack, or execute a hasty flanking maneuver without assessing the terrain, potentially leading to difficulties in navigation and potential ambushes? (R3C5, R4C6)
Would you rely solely on a frontal assault without utilizing other tactics, potentially making your forces predictable and susceptible to countermeasures, or attempt a flanking maneuver without sufficient support, potentially leaving your forces exposed and vulnerable to enemy fire? (R3C7, R4C8)
Will you engage in a frontal assault without a clear objective or strategic plan, potentially resulting in a disorganized and ineffective attack, or implement a poorly timed flanking maneuver, potentially leading to missed opportunities and a lack of synchronization with other units? (R3C9, R4C10)
Do you intend to underestimate the enemy's defenses during a frontal assault, risking unexpected resistance and heavy losses, or fail to adapt and adjust during a flanking maneuver, potentially leaving your forces vulnerable to the enemy's counter-strategies? (R3C11, R4C12)
Will you employ diversionary tactics to draw the enemy's attention away from the main attack, potentially creating confusion and opportunities, or utilize specialized units to neutralize the enemy's strongest defenses before launching the assault, potentially ensuring a smoother advance?
