You're at a party and the host suggests playing games like Beer Pong, Truth or Dare, Tagging, Leaser fight, Would You Rather etc. You can take part in would you rather and answer a series of hypothetical questions and explain your choice or sit back and listen to others' answers without participating or pick some other games.
