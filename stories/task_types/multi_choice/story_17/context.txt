You are at a party. You might have to choose between dancing, playing a drinking game, or sitting and chatting with friends. The benefit of dancing could be having fun and getting exercise, but the cost could be feeling self-conscious or getting tired. The benefit of playing a drinking game could be feeling more social, but the cost could be getting too drunk. The benefit of sitting and chatting with friends could be having a more relaxed time, but the cost could be feeling left out if everyone else is doing something else.
