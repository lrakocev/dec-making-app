You are at a buffet with a wide variety of dishes. The probability of enjoying most of the foods depends on multiple factors like tasting a little bit of different cuisines or just going for the known delicious dishes, cooking styles, how picky eater you are etc. So, you can try to fill your plate with a mix of different cuisines, trying a little bit of everything or stick to your favorite dish and load up your plate with multiple servings of it.
