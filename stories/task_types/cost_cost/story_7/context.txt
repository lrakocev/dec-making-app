You are at a restaurant with your date/family/friends. You might have to choose between ordering a dish that you really want, but that is very spicy and might upset your stomach, or ordering a dish that you don't like as much, but that is healthier. The cost of ordering the spicy dish could be feeling sick later, but the cost of ordering the healthier dish could be not enjoying your meal as much.
