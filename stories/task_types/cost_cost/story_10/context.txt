Your friend and you were planning a party. You wanted to go all out and rent a fancy venue, hire a live band, and have a gourmet catering service. Your friend, on the other hand, preferred a low-cost approach and suggested hosting the party in their backyard with homemade decorations and a potluck-style meal or rent a small community hall for a reasonable price, hire a DJ instead of a live band.
