You are very supportive of financing an orphan relative. She is in school and is supposed to graduate soon. She might have to choose between a required class for her major and an elective that she is really interested in. The cost of taking the required class could be not being able to explore her interests as much, but the cost of taking the elective could be delaying her graduation or not being able to fulfill major requirements.
