You graduated and now before starting a job you have a couple of weeks' free time. You want to utilize this time by doing something fun. You can either go on a luxurious cruise, indulging in gourmet dining, live entertainment, and exploring exotic destinations or you can organize a karaoke night with friends, belting out your favorite tunes and creating unforgettable memories.
