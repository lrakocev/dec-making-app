You are on vacation in a different country with your significant other. You might have to choose between visiting a museum that you're interested in, but that has a long line and will take up a lot of time or skipping the museum and having more time to explore other parts of the city. The cost of visiting the museum could be feeling tired and not having enough time to see other things, but the cost of skipping it could be feeling like you missed out on something you really wanted to see.
