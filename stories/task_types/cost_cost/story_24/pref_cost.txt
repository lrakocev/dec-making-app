1) High Cost: The development and maintenance of advanced fighter jets can strain military budgets, diverting funds from other important areas like healthcare and education.
2) Low Cost: While drones offer cost-effective reconnaissance capabilities, they can also raise concerns about privacy and ethical implications.
3) High Cost: The complex technology of advanced fighter jets requires extensive training for pilots, adding to the overall expenses.
4) Low Cost: Drones, although cost-effective, may have limitations in certain environments or weather conditions, affecting their operational effectiveness.
5) High Cost: The production and maintenance of fighter jets often involve multinational collaborations, which can lead to challenges in terms of coordination and sharing costs.
6) Low Cost: Drones may be vulnerable to hacking or cyberattacks, potentially compromising sensitive military information.
7) High Cost: The high price tag of advanced fighter jets can limit their availability, potentially impacting the overall military readiness and response capabilities.
8) Low Cost: Drones, being unmanned, lack the human decision-making capabilities and adaptability that pilots possess in dynamic situations.
9) High Cost: The extensive research and development required for advanced fighter jets can lead to delays and cost overruns, impacting military timelines and budgets.
10) 10. Low Cost: Drones, while cost-effective for reconnaissance, may not have the same level of endurance or range as manned aircraft, limiting their operational capabilities.
11) 11. High Cost: The maintenance and logistics involved in supporting advanced fighter jets can be complex and expensive, requiring specialized infrastructure and personnel.
12) 12. Low Cost: Drones, being reliant on batteries, have limited endurance and may require frequent recharging or battery replacement, affecting their operational availability.
