You're a military commander and you've just received orders to bomb a city that's being used as a base by enemy forces. You know that bombing the city will cause a lot of civilian casualties, but you also know that if you don't bomb the city, your own forces will be at risk. You have to choose between following orders and potentially causing a lot of civilian deaths or disobeying orders and potentially putting your own forces at risk. What would you do?
