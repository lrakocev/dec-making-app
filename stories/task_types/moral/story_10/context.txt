One day, you find a wallet on the street. You opened the wallet and saw it has a lot of money in it. You know that you should return the wallet to its owner, but you also knew that you could really use the money as you are really hungry and have no groceries at home and you do not have enough money to spend on food. You have to choose between being honest and returning the wallet or keeping the money for yourself. What do you think you should do?
