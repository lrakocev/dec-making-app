You're a military medic and you've just received two patients who were injured in battle. One patient is a fellow soldier who is badly injured but has a good chance of survival with immediate treatment. The other patient is a civilian who is also badly injured but has a lower chance of survival, even with immediate treatment. You have to choose between treating the soldier and potentially saving their life, or treating the civilian and potentially losing the soldier. What would you do?
