You are driving down the road when you see a group of people standing near a car that has crashed into a tree. You stop to help and realize that the driver of the car is a well-known criminal who is wanted by the police. You have a chance to turn the criminal in and collect a large reward (5 million dollars), but if you do, you will be breaking your promise to keep the criminal's identity a secret.
