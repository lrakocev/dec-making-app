1) Request additional intelligence to confirm the presence of civilians near the target before proceeding
2) Communicate with ground forces to coordinate a ground operation instead of an aerial bombing to minimize civilian casualties
3) Explore alternative methods, such as targeted strikes or precision-guided munitions, to minimize collateral damage
4) Advocate for a change in the mission objective to prioritize the safety of civilians over immediate destruction
5) Initiate a dialogue with local authorities or humanitarian organizations to facilitate the evacuation of civilians from the area
6) Utilize advanced reconnaissance technology to gather real-time information and identify civilian-populated areas to avoid during the attack.
