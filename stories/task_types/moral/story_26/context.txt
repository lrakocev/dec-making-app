Imagine you're at a restaurant and you order a dish that you've been craving for a while. When the food arrives, you realize that the portion is much larger than you expected, and you won't be able to finish it all. Do you waste the food and leave it uneaten, or do you ask for a take-out container and save the leftovers for later?
