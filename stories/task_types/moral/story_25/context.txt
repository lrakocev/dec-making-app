You're visiting a foreign country known for its rich cultural heritage. While exploring a local market, you come across a vendor selling what appears to be an ancient artifact. The vendor claims it's authentic and offers it to you at a high price. Do you buy it, even though there's a chance it could be stolen or illegally obtained, or do you choose not to support the potential illicit trade of cultural artifacts?
