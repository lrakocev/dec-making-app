Imagine you went for a trip to a beautiful national park, and you come across a sign that says, "Do not pick flowers and plants." However, you see some rare and exquisite flowers and find plants you've never seen before. Do you pick the flowers and plants to keep as a souvenir or do you respect the park's rules and leave it untouched?
