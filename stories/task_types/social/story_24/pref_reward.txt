1) Look for a restaurant that offers a diverse menu with both pizza and sushi options, so you can each get what you're craving
2) Consider ordering from a place that specializes in fusion cuisine, where you can find unique dishes that combine elements of both pizza and sushi
3) Explore the idea of getting a half-and-half pizza, with one side topped with your favorite pizza toppings and the other side with sushi-inspired ingredients
4) Research if there are any sushi rolls that incorporate pizza flavors, like a sushi roll with marinara sauce or toppings inspired by pizza ingredients
5) Discuss the possibility of ordering pizza for the main course and sushi for appetizers or vice versa, allowing both cravings to be satisfied
6) Consider having a "food adventure" night where you order both pizza and sushi, and take turns trying each other's dishes to experience the best of both worlds
