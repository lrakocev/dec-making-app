You are a manager, and you have to decide between two options. Option one is to promote an employee who has been with the company for a long time but may not have the necessary skills for the job. Option two is to promote a newer employee who has the necessary skills but has not been with the company as long. If you promote the long-time employee, you'll potentially be rewarding loyalty and dedication to the company. However, you may also be promoting someone who doesn't have the necessary skills for the job, which could negatively impact the team and the company. If you promote the newer employee, you'll potentially be promoting someone who has the necessary skills for the job and can positively impact the team and the company. However, you may also be overlooking the long-time employee's loyalty and dedication to the company, which could negatively impact morale. Ultimately, you have to decide which choice is more important to you. Is it more important to promote the long-time employee to reward loyalty and dedication, or to promote the newer employee who has the necessary skills for the job? It's a tough decision, but it's one that only you can make based on the situation at hand.
