1) Choose option one and immediately confront your friend about their significant other's infidelity without considering the potential impact on their relationship and friendship, potentially causing unnecessary conflict and strain
2) Opt for option two and completely ignore the information about your friend's significant other cheating, disregarding the potential emotional pain and harm they may be experiencing, and potentially damaging your own conscience and integrity
3) Accuse your friend's significant other of cheating without concrete evidence or proof, potentially causing unnecessary drama and tension within their relationship and friendship
4) Share the information about the infidelity with others without your friend's consent or knowledge, potentially causing rumors and gossip that could further damage their relationship and social dynamics
5) Take matters into your own hands and confront the significant other directly without involving your friend, potentially escalating the situation and causing more harm than good
6) Dismiss your friend's concerns and emotions about their relationship, invalidating their feelings and potentially damaging your friendship by not offering the support they may need
