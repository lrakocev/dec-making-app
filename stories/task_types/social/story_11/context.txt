You are a teacher and you have to decide between two options. Option one is to give a student a failing grade on an assignment, but risk negatively impacting their self-esteem and motivation. Option two is to give the student a passing grade on the assignment, even though they didn't meet the necessary requirements, in order to boost their self-esteem and motivation. If you give the student a failing grade, you'll potentially be providing them with constructive feedback and helping them learn from their mistakes. However, you may also be negatively impacting their self-esteem and motivation, which could have long-term consequences for their academic performance. If you give the student a passing grade, you'll potentially be boosting their self-esteem and motivation, which could have positive consequences for their academic performance. However, you may also be overlooking the fact that the student didn't meet the necessary requirements, which could negatively impact their future academic and career success. Ultimately, you have to decide which choice is more important to you. Is it more important to give the student constructive feedback and help them learn from their mistakes, or to boost their self-esteem and motivation even if it means overlooking the fact that they didn't meet the necessary requirements? It's a tough decision, but it's one that only you can make based on the situation at hand.
