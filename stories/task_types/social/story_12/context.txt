You are a manager in a car show room, and you have to decide between two options. Option one is to fire an employee who has consistently underperformed, but risk negatively impacting their financial stability and future job prospects. Option two is to keep the employee on staff, even though they haven't met the necessary requirements, in order to avoid negatively impacting their financial stability and job prospects. If you fire the employee, you'll potentially be able to find a more qualified and productive employee to replace them. However, you may also be negatively impacting the fired employee's financial stability and future job prospects, which could have long-term consequences for their career and personal life.If you keep the employee on staff, you'll potentially be avoiding negatively impacting their financial stability and job prospects, which could have positive consequences for their personal and professional life. However, you may also be overlooking the fact that the employee hasn't met the necessary requirements, which could negatively impact the productivity and success of your team. Ultimately, you have to decide which choice is more important to you. Is it more important to find a more qualified and productive employee to replace the underperforming employee, or to avoid negatively impacting the underperforming employee's financial stability and job prospects? It's a tough decision, but it's one that only you can make based on the situation at hand.
